## open-meteo adapter for ioBroker

Weather forecast from [OpenMeteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/dwd-api)

In the instance setting, individual variables can be activated for 15 minutes, hourly, daily and currently.
Each variable has a factor of 1.7 queries. A maximum of 10,000 queries per day is allowed. 79 variables can be selected.
This would be 79 x 1.7 = 134.3 requests per request.
